Meshcraft
=========
With Meshcraft you can organize your notes/presentations/texts in a mesh using your browser.

The live site at http://meshcraft.net/ is currently running version 0.1.

Meshcraft tries to be compatible with all major browsers. However, Chrome/Chromium performs best.

Versions
========
Version 0.1 is a demo of the clients user interface (shell). It is not yet ready for productive work and does not communicate with server. Everything is cached in the browser.

Roadmap
=======
Version 0.2:

 * Live communication with the server using a multi-user editing protocol (causal consistency / action transformation)
 * Undo/Redo
 * Multiple Spaces (at least "Welcome", "Sandbox" and one personal per user)

Further Down the Road
---------------------
(in no particular order)

 * Bold / Italic texts (text trees go deeper than just paragraphs)
 * Include Images. (also for space consideration be able to use hosted images elsewhere)
 * Zooming
 * Zooming Presentations
 * Spell checking
 * Create TeX-documents from a Path through Notes.
 * QDA: Use the Meshcraft infrastructure to offer QDA-abilities
 * ease usage as Concept Maps ("mindmaps" (TM))
 * Item grouping
 * Accessibility
 * Literature administriation nodes
